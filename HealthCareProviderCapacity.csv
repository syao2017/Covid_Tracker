"Notes"
"ICU Beds data include coronary, trauma, surgical, burn, and general ICU beds in community and non-Federal hospitals. Figures may not sum to totals due to rounding."
""
"For purposes of these data, Community Health Centers (CHCs) include Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), which meet federal health center requirements and receive federal grants under Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act. Other community health centers known as ""look-alikes,"" which also meet federal health center requirements but do not receive Section 330 grants, are not included. There are approximately 100 look-alikes nationwide."
